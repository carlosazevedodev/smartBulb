# smartBulb
A simple project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to simulate a SmartBulb. 
I made a simple project using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a lamp project, styled in CSS, with an On/Off button that turns it on and off.
In JavaScript, I added a variable to control the lamp's state and a counter to record how many times the lamp is turned on and off. 
When the button is clicked, the function toggles the lamp's state, updates the CSS class, and displays messages in the console to simulate a more intelligent behavior.
